# AdventOfCode2024Day2

Here’s my Advent of Code 2024, Day 2 solution. Feel free to leave a review if you’d like!

## About

This solution is written in C# and focuses on reading and processing data from a file to calculate the required results. It uses basic file handling, sorting, and list operations to reconcile two lists of numbers.

## How to Run

- Ensure the `input.txt` file is placed in the `data` directory at the root of the project.
- Build and run the solution using Visual Studio or any compatible .NET environment.

## Feedback

Suggestions for optimization or improvements are always welcome!
